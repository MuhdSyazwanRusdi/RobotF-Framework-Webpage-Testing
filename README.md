# Robotframework_Project

Robot Framework is an open-source test automation framework, exclusively designed for acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven development. The environment it uses is built with a number of libraries and tools. If comparing Robot Framework with other test automation tools, then the best benefit with Robot Framework for the users is that there is no need for using any sort of programming language for implementing and running tests.

## Benefit:

- It is open-source framework.
- It follows keyword driven, behaviour driven and data driven approach for writing test script.
- Robot Framework has very easy syntax and uses human readable keywords.
- It capabilities can be extended libraries implemented in Java and python.
- Robot framework is extensively used for RPA, Database, API automation & Web automation.
- This is the only framework which comes with all industry standard framework features with very minimal coding

## Limitation:
Robot lacks support for if-else, nested loops, which are required when the code gets complex.
